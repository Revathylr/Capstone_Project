# Capstone_Project_Predictive_maintenance
PREDICTIVE MAINTENANCE OF MACHINES AND INDUSTRIAL EQUIPMENT
The primary objective of this project is to develop a predictive maintenance system using machine learning techniques that can accurately anticipate potential failures or maintenance needs of industrial machinery.

By leveraging sensor dataâ€”specifically Torque [Nm], Rotational Speed [rpm], Process Temperature [K], Air Temperature [K], and Tool Wear [min]

The model aims to:

1.Detect early signs of equipment degradation or malfunction.

2.Classify the operational state of the machine into risk categories.

3.Minimize unplanned downtime and maintenance costs

4.Enable industries to shift from reactive/scheduled maintenance to condition-based and predictive maintenance strategies.

5.Improve overall equipment efficiency, safety, and reliability.

The project will involve data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model development (using classification algorithms), and performance evaluation to deliver a robust predictive maintenance solution.
